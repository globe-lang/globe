# Globe 🌍

> *An experimental network-native programming language.*

---

## Vision

Globe is rethinking how software communicates.

We're not building another framework. We're not building another protocol. We're building a new **mental model** — one where the boundaries between local and remote, between your code and the world's code, simply disappear.

The web was designed for documents. Then we hacked it for applications. 

Globe is what comes next.

## Philosophy

- **Network-native by design** — not an afterthought
- **Unified execution model** — one process, infinite scale
- **Trust as a first-class citizen** — permissions and identity, built into the language
- **Zero glue code** — if it exists, you can call it

## Status

```

Active research & development.

Core language design in progress.

## Why Now?

The primitives are finally here. WASM. Edge computing. Content-addressed code. Distributed identity.

The question was never *if*. It was *when*.

The answer is now.
